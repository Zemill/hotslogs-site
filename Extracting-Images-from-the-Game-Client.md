Here is a little console application that will extract all images: https://d1i1jxrdh2kvwy.cloudfront.net/Data/ExtractHotSImages.zip

It will extract all images from the 'Heroes of the Storm' game client in their native .DDS format.  Unfortunately I don't have an easy way to convert from DDS automatically, but there are photo tools that can do this for you.

This super cool program requires HotS to be installed at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroes of the Storm" - make sure you install it here :)

It will output all images in .DDS format to "C:\HotSExtractedImages" - make sure you create this directory before running :)

Currently there are about 35,000 images.  Thankfully their file names are helpful, and if you sort by size, usually the most interesting ones are bigger.

If you want to browse the data files manually, you can use 'CascView': http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html
