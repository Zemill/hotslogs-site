  for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites,
  services or applications that may be linked to or from the Services . You should review the policies of such third

  <b>In Short:</b><i> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
    notice unless otherwise required by law.</i><br /><br />
  We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
  notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
  requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years
  past the termination of the user's account. <br /><br />
  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
  anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
  archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
  deletion is possible. <br /><br />

  <span class="font-plus-2">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</span> <br /><br />
  <b>In Short:</b><i> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
    security measures.</i><br /><br />
  We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
  personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is
  100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information
  to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.
  <br /><br />

  <span class="font-plus-2">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</span>? <br /><br />
  <b>In Short:</b><i> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access
    to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
    time.</i><br /><br />
  In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws.
  These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
  rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to
  data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
  information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any
  request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. <br /><br />
  If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
  any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
  withdrawal.<br /><br />
  If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
  information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find
  their contact details here: <a
    href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.

  databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with
  any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements. <br /><br />
  <b>Cookies and similar technologies:</b> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you

  <span class="font-plus-2">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</span> <br /><br />
  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or
  setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
  monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
  finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
  communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
  the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. <br /><br />

  residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal
